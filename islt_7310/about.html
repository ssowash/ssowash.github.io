<h3>Welcome to my website! Here you will find everything you need to know about me.</h3>

<main><p>Hello everybody! My name Sam Sowash
    and I am a senior geography major with an emphasis in geographic information systems,
    semester of school. I come from St. Louis, <strong>Missouri.</strong> Some of my interests include
    playing video games, weightlifting, and traveling. The only other web design class I have
    taken was in high school about 6 years ago. I really enjoyed that class, so I hope the
    same for this one. <br/> I’m not <em>required</em> to take this class but thought it would be interesting
    since I needed some extra credits to graduate. My expectation for this class is to learn
    very basic web page design. I don’t know if I will ever do anything with the skills learned
    from this class, but <em>maybe</em> it will come in handy in a future job. Even if I never use these
    skills, I still think it will be useful to have.</p></main>
