<main><h2>Welcome to my website! Here you will find everything you need to know about me.</h2><p>I created this website so that all my education and work experience can be easily accessed by anybody. Here you will find all the information about my education and some projects that I have worked on. I will also be adding my job history here as I get more experience in the future. I hope that by creating this website, I can acquire new skills in web page design. My website will be polished and updated to make it more professional over time. Instead of continuously rewriting my paper resume, I can instead just add more experiences to this website. This website also makes it easier for job recruiters to find me. If people search my name in google, there’s a good chance that this website could pop up with all my information on it. Making this website also shows that I take my career seriously. People are also able to see my creative side instead of more resume’s that all look the same.</p></main>
