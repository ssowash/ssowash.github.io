    <main><h2>Welcome to my Reflection Page!</h2><p id="reflection">Throughout my course program experiences, I have had a lot of ups and downs. Some of the classes that I took were very hard, but I was learning a lot in them. Some of the hardest classes were the ones in my emphasis area. I have used applications such as ArcGIS, ERDAS imagine, and QGIS. I know that the more I am exposed to the different software’s, I will get better at using them. I’ve also learned a lot about geography than I thought existed. Geography is more than memorizing places and capitals. It encompasses a lot of subjects and can be applied to almost any career. I hope that I can learn a lot more once I get a job/internship.</p></main>
